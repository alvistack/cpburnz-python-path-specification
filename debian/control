Description: Utility library for gitignore style pattern matching of file paths
 Path Specification (pathspec) is a utility library for pattern matching
 of file paths. So far this only includes Git's wildmatch pattern
 matching which itself is derived from Rsync's wildmatch. Git uses
 wildmatch for its gitignore files.
